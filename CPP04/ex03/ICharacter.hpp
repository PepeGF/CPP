/* The Character possesses an inventory of 4 slots, which means 4 Materias at most.
The inventory is empty at construction. They equip the Materias in the first empty slot
they find. This means, in this order: from slot 0 to slot 3. In case they try to add
a Materia to a full inventory, or use/unequip an unexisting Materia, don’t do anything
(but still, bugs are forbidden). The unequip() member function must NOT delete the
Materia! */

/* Your Character must have a constructor taking its name as a parameter. Any copy
(using copy constructor or copy assignment operator) of a Character must be deep.
During copy, the Materias of a Character must be deleted before the new ones are added
to their inventory. Of course, the Materias must be deleted when a Character is destroyed. */
