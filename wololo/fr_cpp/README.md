# CPP Modules: An Introduction To C++98 | 42

## Overview

These exercises, grouped in modules, allowed me to discover **C++98** in its entirety. They are sorted by order of difficulty and represent the **introduction to C++ at 42**.

- Module 00: Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static and const keywords.
- Module 01: Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement.
- Module 02: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form.
- Module 03: Inheritance, virtual and protected keywords.
- Module 04: Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces.
- Module 05: Repetition and Exceptions, try and catch keywords.
- Module 06: C++ casts like static_cast, reinterpret_cast, const_cast, dynamic_cast.
- Module 07: C++ templates and some other concepts.
- Module 08: Templated containers, iterators, algorithms.

*NB*: 42 School C++ Module 09 wasn't available when I validated the project. Instead, I made [containers](https://github.com/julien-ctx/ft-containers) which is a very nice addition to module 08.
